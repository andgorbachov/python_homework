Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible.
This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.
Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible
interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.
